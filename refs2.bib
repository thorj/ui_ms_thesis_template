  abstract = {Many bioinformatics methods have been proposed for reducing the complexity of large gene or protein networks into relevant subnetworks or modules. Yet, how such methods compare to each other in terms of their ability to identify disease-relevant modules in different types of network remains poorly understood. We launched the 'Disease Module Identification DREAM Challenge', an open competition to comprehensively assess module identification methods across diverse protein-protein interaction, signaling, gene co-expression, homology and cancer-gene networks. Predicted network modules were tested for association with complex traits and diseases using a unique collection of 180 genome-wide association studies. Our robust assessment of 75 module identification methods reveals top-performing algorithms, which recover complementary trait-associated modules. We find that most of these modules correspond to core disease-relevant pathways, which often comprise therapeutic targets. This community challenge establishes biologically interpretable benchmarks, tools and guidelines for molecular network analysis to study human disease biology.},

  abstract = {The blood proteome in disease Understanding the function of human blood serum proteins in disease has been limited by difficulties in monitoring their production, accumulation, and distribution. Emilsson et al. investigated human serum proteins of more than 5000 Icelanders over the age of 65. The composition of blood serum includes a complex regulatory network of proteins that are globally coordinated across most or all tissues. The authors identified modules and functional groups associated with disease and health outcomes and were able to link genetic variants to complex diseases. Science, this issue p. 769 Proteins circulating in the blood are critical for age-related disease processes; however, the serum proteome has remained largely unexplored. To this end, 4137 proteins covering most predicted extracellular proteins were measured in the serum of 5457 Icelanders over 65 years of age. Pairwise correlation between proteins as they varied across individuals revealed 27 different network modules of serum proteins, many of which were associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease states, as well as overall survival. The protein modules were controlled by cis- and trans-acting genetic variants, which in many cases were also associated with complex disease. This revealed co-regulated groups of circulating proteins that incorporated regulatory control between tissues and demonstrated close relationships to past, current, and future disease states. A deep proteome analysis of human serum reveals the relationship between disease and genetics. A deep proteome analysis of human serum reveals the relationship between disease and genetics.},

  abstract = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including {$>$}100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.},

Blood-based factors like serum proteins are in contact with every organ in the body to mediate global homeostasis and may thus directly regulate complex processes such as aging and the development of common chronic diseases. We applied a data-driven proteomics approach, measuring serum levels of 4,137 proteins in 5,438 elderly Icelanders, and identified 536 proteins associated with prevalent and/or incident type 2 diabetes. We validated a subset of the observed associations in an independent case-control study of type 2 diabetes. These protein associations provide novel biological insights into the molecular mechanisms that are dysregulated prior to and following the onset of type 2 diabetes and can be detected in serum. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that serum changes of at least 23 proteins are downstream of the disease or its genetic liability, while 15 proteins were supported as having a causal role in type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {Inference about the causal structure that induces correlations between two traits can be achieved by combining genetic associations with a mediation-based approach, as is done in the causal inference test (CIT). However, we show that measurement error in the phenotypes can lead to the CIT inferring the wrong causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. This problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be performed using only summary level data from genome-wide association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses alongside other approaches such as CIT is important to triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.},

Several high-profile situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different findings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modifiable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of IV analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as 'Mendelian randomization', and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials.

The integration of HuRI with genome3, transcriptome4 and proteome5 data enables cellular function to be studied within most physiological or pathological cellular contexts. We demonstrate the utility of HuRI in identifying the specific subcellular roles of protein–protein interactions. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms that might underlie tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Comparing transcript levels between healthy and diseased individuals allows the identification of differentially expressed genes, which may be causes, consequences or mere correlates of the disease under scrutiny. Here, we propose a bi-directional Transcriptome-Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR) approach that integrates summary-level data from GWAS and whole-blood eQTLs in a MR framework to investigate the causal effects between gene expression and complex traits. Whereas we have previously developed a TWMR approach to elucidate gene expression to trait causal effects, here we are adapting the method to shed light on the causal imprint of complex traits on transcript levels. We termed this new approach reverse TWMR (revTWMR). Integrating bi-directional causal effects between gene expression and complex traits enables to evaluate their respective contributions to the correlation between gene expression and traits. We uncovered that whole blood gene expression-trait correlation is mainly driven by causal effect from the phenotype on the expression rather than the reverse. For example, BMI- and triglycerides-gene expression correlation coefficients robustly correlate with trait-to-expression causal effects (r=0.09, P=1.54x10\textsuperscript{-39} and r=0.09, P=1.19x10\textsuperscript{-34}, respectively), but not detectably with expression-to-trait effects. Genes implicated by revTWMR confirmed known associations, such as rheumathoid arthritis and Crohn9s disease induced changes in expression of \emph{TRBV} and \emph{GBP2}, respectively. They also shed light on how clinical biomarkers can influence their own levels. For instance, we observed that high levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol lowers the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (\emph{SQLE}, \emph{FDFT1}) and increases the expression of genes responsible for cholesterol efflux (\emph{ABCA1}, \emph{ABCG1}), two key molecular pathways in determining HDL levels. Importantly, revTWMR is more robust to pleiotropy than polygenic risk score (PRS) approaches which can be misled by pleiotropic outliers. As one example, revTWMR revealed that the previously reported association between educational attainment PRS and \emph{STX1B} is exclusively driven by a highly pleiotropic SNP (rs2456973), which is strongly associated with several hematological and anthropometric traits. In conclusion, our method disentangles the relationship between gene expression and phenotypes and reveals that complex traits have more pronounced impact on gene expression than the reverse. We demonstrated that studies comparing the transcriptome of diseased and healthy subjects are more prone to reveal disease-induced gene expression changes rather than disease causing ones.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Integrative analyses of human and mouse data to characterise these associations revealed a role for polygenic effects on several well-known causal disease proteins and identified promising novel targets for future follow-up. We found implicated PRS-associated genes were responsive to dietary intervention in mice and showed strong evidence of druggability in humans, consistent with PRS-associated proteins having therapeutic potential.

However, causal inference is undermined if genetic variants used to instrument a risk factor also influence alternative disease-pathways (horizontal pleiotropy). Here we report how the ‘no horizontal pleiotropy assumption’ is strengthened when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are typically the proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome. Moreover, proteins are the targets of most medicines, so MR studies of drug targets are becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies, we introduce a mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to disease. We illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework for maximising power and evaluating the robustness of analyses.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization refers to an analytic approach to assess the causality of an observed association between a modifiable exposure or risk factor and a clinically relevant outcome. It presents a valuable tool, especially when randomized controlled trials to examine causality are not feasible and observational studies provide biased associations because of confounding or reverse causality. These issues are addressed by using genetic variants as instrumental variables for the tested exposure: the alleles of this exposure–associated genetic variant are randomly allocated and not subject to reverse causation. This, together with the wide availability of published genetic associations to screen for suitable genetic instrumental variables make Mendelian randomization a time- and cost-efficient approach and contribute to its increasing popularity for assessing and screening for potentially causal associations. An observed association between the genetic instrumental variable and the outcome supports the hypothesis that the exposure in question is causally related to the outcome. This review provides an overview of the Mendelian randomization method, addresses assumptions and implications, and includes illustrative examples. We also discuss special issues in nephrology, such as inverse risk factor associations in advanced disease, and outline opportunities to design Mendelian randomization studies around kidney function and disease.},

An unintended consequence of the growing use of biomarkers—for example, in assessing nutritional status—is that investigators are less aware of the continued threats to validity of their findings caused by measurement error, confounding, and reverse causality, which affect biomarkers in the same way as exposures and outcomes measured using less precise methods. This chapter briefly outlines when and why conventional observational approaches have been misleading and then introduces the Mendelian randomization approach, a form of the use of genes as instrumental variables as briefly discussed by Douglas Ewbank in the earlier Cells and Surveys volume (Ewbank, 2001). The variety of inferences that can be drawn from this approach is illustrated and then potential limitations and ways to address these limitations are outlined. The chapter concludes by summarizing the ways in which Mendelian randomization approaches differ from other methodologies that depend on the use of genetic markers in population-based research.},

Blood circulating protein are confounded readouts of the biological processes that occur in different tissues and organs of the human body. Many proteins have been linked to complex disorders and are also under substantial genetic control. Here, we investigate the associations between over 1,000 blood circulating proteins and body mass index (BMI) in three studies, including over 4,600 participants. We show that BMI is associated with widespread changes in the plasma proteome. We report 152 protein associations with BMI that replicate in at least one other study. 24 proteins also associate with a genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) for BMI. These proteins are involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways impacting clinically relevant pathways of adiposity. Mendelian randomization suggests a bi-directional causal relationship of BMI with three proteins (LEPR, IGFBP1, and WFIKKN2), a protein-to-BMI relationship for three proteins (AGER, DPT, and CTSA), and a BMI-to-protein relationship for 21 other proteins. Combined with animal model and tissue-specific gene expression data, our findings suggest potential therapeutic targets and further elucidate the biological role of these proteins in pathologies associated with obesity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Of 413 associations supported by evidence from MR, 130 (31.5\%) were not supported by results of colocalization analyses, suggesting that genetic confounding due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) is widespread in naive phenome-wide association studies of proteins. Combining MR and colocalization evidence in cis-only analyses, we identified 111 putatively causal effects between 65 proteins and 52 disease-related phenotypes (www.epigraphdb.org/pqtl/). Evaluation of data from historic drug development programmes showed that target-indication pairs with MR and colocalization support were more likely to be approved, evidencing the value of our approach in identifying and prioritising potential therapeutic targets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Mendelian randomization (MR) is a strategy for evaluating causality in observational epidemiological studies. MR exploits the fact that genotypes are not generally susceptible to reverse causation and confounding, due to their fixed nature and Mendel’s First and Second Laws of Inheritance. MR has the potential to provide information on causality in many situations where randomized controlled trials are not possible, but the results of MR studies must be interpreted carefully to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions. Recent Findings In this review, we outline the principles behind MR, as well as assumptions and limitations of the method. Extensions to the basic approach are discussed, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, two-step MR, multivariable MR, and factorial MR. We also consider some new applications and recent developments in the methodology, including its ability to inform drug development, automation of the method using tools such as MR-Base, and phenome-wide and hypothesis-free MR. Summary In conjunction with the growing availability of large-scale genomic databases, higher level of automation and increased robustness of the methods, MR promises to be a valuable strategy to examine causality in complex biological/omics networks, inform drug development and prioritize intervention targets for disease prevention in the future.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method of exploiting genetic variation to unbiasedly estimate a causal effect in presence of unmeasured confounding. MR is being widely used in epidemiology and other related areas of population science. In this paper, we study statistical inference in the increasingly popular two-sample summary-data MR design. We show a linear model for the observed associations approximately holds in a wide variety of settings when all the genetic variants satisfy the exclusion restriction assumption, or in genetic terms, when there is no pleiotropy. In this scenario, we derive a maximum profile likelihood estimator with provable consistency and asymptotic normality. However, through analyzing real datasets, we find strong evidence of both systematic and idiosyncratic pleiotropy in MR, echoing the omnigenic model of complex traits that is recently proposed in genetics. We model the systematic pleiotropy by a random effects model, where no genetic variant satisfies the exclusion restriction condition exactly. In this case we propose a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator by adjusting the profile score. We then tackle the idiosyncratic pleiotropy by robustifying the adjusted profile score. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods using several simulated and real datasets.},

  abstract = {Developments in genome‐wide association studies and the increasing availability of summary genetic association data have made application of Mendelian randomization relatively straightforward. However, obtaining reliable results from a Mendelian randomization investigation remains problematic, as the conventional inverse‐variance weighted method only gives consistent estimates if all of the genetic variants in the analysis are valid instrumental variables. We present a novel weighted median estimator for combining data on multiple genetic variants into a single causal estimate. This estimator is consistent even when up to 50\% of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables. In a simulation analysis, it is shown to have better finite‐sample Type 1 error rates than the inverse‐variance weighted method, and is complementary to the recently proposed MR‐Egger (Mendelian randomization‐Egger) regression method. In analyses of the causal effects of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary artery disease risk, the inverse‐variance weighted method suggests a causal effect of both lipid fractions, whereas the weighted median and MR‐Egger regression methods suggest a null effect of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol that corresponds with the experimental evidence. Both median‐based and MR‐Egger regression methods should be considered as sensitivity analyses for Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants.},
